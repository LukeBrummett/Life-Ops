## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Life-Ops is built around these core principles:

- **Offline-Only**: Zero network dependencies, complete privacy
- **Deterministic Scheduling**: Tasks appear based on explicit rules, never algorithmic guessing
- **Next-Occurrence Timeline**: Each task appears only once at its next scheduled date
- **Configuration Over Motivation**: Set up task logic once, execute without thinking
- **Cognitive Offload**: The app remembers, you just complete visible tasks
