# Life-Ops v1.0.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Task Editing
- **Fixed save button not working in TaskEditScreen**
  - Issue: Clicking save after editing a task did not navigate to the task detail screen
  - Cause: Event consumption was happening before navigation callbacks
  - Resolution: Reordered event handling to execute navigation first, then consume the event
  - Impact: Users can now successfully save task edits and see the updated task

- **Fixed ADHOC tasks unable to be saved**
  - Issue: One-time tasks (like "Call dentist about appointment") could not be saved after editing
  - Cause: Validation incorrectly required `intervalQty >= 1` for ALL task types
  - Resolution: Updated validation to allow `intervalQty = 0` for ADHOC tasks
  - Impact: Ad-hoc/one-time tasks can now be edited and saved properly

### Sample Data
- **Fixed crash when loading sample data**
  - Issue: "Cannot access database on main thread" error when clicking "Load Sample Data" in Settings
  - Cause: `database.clearAllTables()` was executing on the main UI thread
  - Resolution: Wrapped database operation in `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`
  - Impact: Sample data loads successfully without blocking the UI or causing crashes
