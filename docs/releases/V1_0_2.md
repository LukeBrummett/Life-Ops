# Life-Ops v1.0.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Today View - ADHOC Child Task Query
- **Fixed ADHOC child tasks showing incorrectly in Today view**
  - Issue: ADHOC child tasks were appearing in the Today view just because their parent task was due, even when the ADHOC task itself was not triggered (nextDue = null)
  - Resolution: Updated query logic to only show ADHOC tasks when explicitly triggered (nextDue is set)
  - Impact: Today view now correctly filters ADHOC tasks, only showing them when they should be actionable
  - Test Coverage: Added 4 comprehensive test cases covering all ADHOC task scenarios:
    - ADHOC with null nextDue (not triggered) → should NOT appear
    - ADHOC with nextDue set (triggered) → should appear
    - ADHOC completed but never triggered → should NOT appear
    - ADHOC completed and was triggered → should appear

### Test Infrastructure
- **Fixed androidTest compilation errors**
  - Issue: Test method names with backticks (containing spaces) caused DEX compilation failures on minSdk 26
  - Cause: Spaces in method names require DEX version 040 (Android API 31+), but project targets API 26
  - Resolution: Renamed test methods to use camelCase without spaces
  - Impact: All instrumented tests now compile and run successfully

- **Added missing test dependencies**
  - Added junit, test-core, runner, and rules dependencies for androidTest
  - Ensures all Android instrumented tests have proper dependency support

## ✨ New Features

### Task Creation - Next Due Date Field
Added a new "Next Due Date" field to the task creation and editing interface:

- **Custom Due Date Selection**: Users can now set a custom due date when creating or editing tasks
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Provides better control over when tasks should first appear
- **Preserved for ADHOC Tasks**: ADHOC tasks can have a next due date set when triggered
- **User-Friendly**: Date picker interface makes it easy to schedule tasks for specific dates

**Use Cases:**
- Schedule a task to start in the future
- Set a custom first occurrence for recurring tasks
- Trigger ADHOC tasks for specific dates
